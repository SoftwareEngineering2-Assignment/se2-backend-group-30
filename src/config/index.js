// This is a common way to export the mongoose object from a Node.js module.

// The mongoose object is typically used to interact 
// with a MongoDB database from a Node.js application. 
// This code exports the mongoose object so that it can be 
// imported and used in other parts of the application.

// In this code, the mongoose object is imported from a 
// local mongoose module, which is presumably defined elsewhere 
// in the application. The module.exports statement then exports 
// the mongoose object so that it can be used in other parts of the 
// application by importing this module.
const mongoose = require('./mongoose');

module.exports = {mongoose};
