// This code exports an object that contains a single property: 
// mailer, which is a reference to a module that exports an object 
// with methods for sending emails.
// This approach is known as "module bundling," which allows the 
// application to group several related modules or functions into a single 
// module and expose only what is necessary to other parts of the code.
// In this particular case, the mailer module is responsible for sending 
// emails, and it is wrapped inside an object to improve 
// the application's organization and maintainability.
const mailer = require('./mailer');
